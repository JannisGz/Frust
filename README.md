Frust
==============


This is a game project created with Android Studio for android phones. 

Green and red shapes will appear on the screen and move around. Touching the green shapes (targets) will increase 
the players score, but hitting a red shape (enemy) ends the game.

When enough targets have been hit the next level will start. There are three different level 
modes you can explore. However, the difficulty will increase with every level you are able to beat.

There is an executable apk in the main folder. You can move this file to your phone to install the application.

To fully view the project structure and code you will need to install Android Studio.
